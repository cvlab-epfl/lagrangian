# lagrangian
Constrained optimization using lagrange multipliers:

- batchoptim.py is the main file that implements the KKT solver.
- tstLagrange.py contains a few toy examples that can be used to test it.
- ConstrainedLsq.pdf is a 2010 tech report that provides the mathematical basis for this code. 

 If you find this code useful and use it in one or your publications, please reference
